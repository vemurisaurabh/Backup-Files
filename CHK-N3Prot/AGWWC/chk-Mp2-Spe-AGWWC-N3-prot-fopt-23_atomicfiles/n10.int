 Portions Copyright (c) 1997-2011 by Todd A. Keith
 AIMInt is a component of the AIMAll package ( http://aim.tkgristmill.com )

 AIMInt is a heavily modified and extended version of the PROAIMV program
 developed by members of R.F.W. Bader's research group

 Much of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) is described in the book:
   "Atoms in Molecules - A Quantum Theory"
   R.F.W. Bader, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990
